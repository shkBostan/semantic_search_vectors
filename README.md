# Semantic Search Vectors

A project for transforming words and sentences into vector embeddings and calculating semantic similarity.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Convert sentences into vector embeddings using [Sentence-Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/).
- Compute similarity between sentences using cosine similarity.
- Modular code structure for future development (e.g., semantic search, vector databases).
